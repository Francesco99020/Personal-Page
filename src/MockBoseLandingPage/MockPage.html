With adjustable noise cancelling, you can control how much — or how little — of the outside world you hear. Plus, Conversation Mode lets you simultaneously adjust noise cancelling and pause your music for a quick chat.</p>

                    <p class="Review-Card-Review">I deal with a slight hearing loss so I tend to turn my music and Tv up when Im listing to them. My Bose 700 headphones now connect to everything I own with the push of a button and alleviate that. I mix music and videos so now I can work and play with out disturbing my family and friends. I can work for hours and not get head clamp pain. If you'r on the fence or hesitant ~ Stop, Pick up a pair and see what you haven't been hearing and feeling. I have everything from (2) pair's of Bose 901's dating back to 1979 to the (2) Bose L1M2 towers and (2) B2 Bases. Life is Better listening an hearing it through Bose.</p>

I ended up buying a second pair because they are so great! Touch controls are very easy and convenient to use as well. Highly recommend!</p>

                    <p class="Review-Card-Review">I recently used my Bose cancelling headphones 700 when I travelled to Asia for 16 hours. I love it. It truly delivered a crisp sound with the option of full noise cancelling and half of the noise. It was comfortable to use and I did not feel that it was heating my ears as I used it for my entire trip. It was easy to use and connected to both my iPhone and iPad without any issues. I just wish they had a longer cord to manually connect the headphones to the audio system of the airplane when I was watching a movie. Luckily I have my old QC20 cancelling noise headphones with me so I used that instead.</p>
